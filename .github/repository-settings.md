# Repository settings

Same as [opentelemetry-java-instrumentation repository settings](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/blob/main/.github/repository-settings.md#repository-settings),
except that the branch protection rules for `release/*`, `gh-pages`, and `opentelemetrybot/*` are not needed in this repository.
