# Java OpenTelemetry Examples

This repository contains a set of fully functional, working examples of using the
OpenTelemetry Java APIs and SDK. All examples can be run locally. Some
examples require Docker to be running on your local machine.

## Requirements

Java 17 or higher is required to build the examples in this repository.
To check your Java version, run:

```bash
java -version
```

To build the all of examples, run:

```bash
./gradlew assemble
```

## Example Modules

- [Using the SDK AutoConfiguration module](autoconfigure)
    - This module contains a fully functional example of using the autoconfigure
      SDK extension module to configure the SDK using only environment
      variables (or system properties).
    - Note: the `opentelemetry-sdk-extension-autoconfigure` module is still
      experimental at this time.
- [Manual instrumentation of HTTP](http)
    - This module provides an example of writing manual instrumentation for
      HTTP, both client and server.
    - Note: More production-ready instrumentation for HTTP is provided as part
      of the [OpenTelemetry Java Instrumentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation)
      project.
- [Manual span creation and baggage propagation](manual-tracing)
    - This module provides an example of manually creating spans using the
      OpenTelemetry API with the ExtendedTracer.
    - Additionally, it demonstrates how to use the OpenTelemetry API to
      propagate baggage items.
- [Configuring the Jaeger Exporter](jaeger)
    - This module contains a fully functional example of configuring the
      OpenTelemetry SDK to use a Jaeger exporter and send spans to it
      using the OpenTelemetry API.
    - Note: This example requires Docker to be installed.
- [Using the OpenTelemetry Java Agent](javaagent)
    - This module demonstrates using the OpenTelemetry Java Agent with a simple
      Spring Boot application. Traces, metrics, and logs are exported to a
      collector via OTLP.
- [Spring native image telemetry with OpenTelemetry Spring Starter](spring-native)
    - This module demonstrates using the OpenTelemetry Spring Boot starter with a
      GraalVM native image. Traces and metrics are exported to a collector via OTLP.
- [Configuring Log Appenders](log-appender)
    - This module demonstrates how to configure the Log4j and Logback appenders to
      bridge logs into the OpenTelemetry Log SDK.
- [Configuring the Logging Exporters](logging)
    - This module contains a fully functional example of configuring the
      OpenTelemetry SDK to use a logging exporter.
- [Exporting application logs using JSON logging in Kubernetes](logging-k8s-stdout-otlp-json)
    - This module demonstrates how to export application logs using JSON logging
      in Kubernetes.
- [Using the OpenTelemetry metrics API](metrics)
    - This module contains examples of using the OpenTelemetry metrics APIs.
- [Using OpenTelemetry Micrometer shim](micrometer-shim)
    - This module contains an example of a typical Micrometer setup (Spring Boot
      with Spring Boot Actuator) configured to bridge metrics to OpenTelemetry
      with the Micrometer shim.
    - Note: The Micrometer shim is still experimental at this time.
- [Setting up OTLP exporters](otlp)
    - OTLP is the OpenTelemetry Protocol. This module demonstrates how to
      configure the OTLP exporters and send data to the OpenTelemetry Collector
      using them.
    - Note: This example requires Docker to be installed.
- [Setting up the Prometheus exporter](prometheus)
    - This module shows how to configure the OpenTelemetry SDK to expose an
      endpoint that can be scraped by Prometheus.
    - Note: The Prometheus metric reader is still experimental at this time.
- [Manually Configuring the SDK](sdk-usage)
    - This module shows some concrete examples of manually configuring the
      OpenTelemetry SDK for tracing.
- [Telemetry Testing](telemetry-testing)
    - This module demonstrates how to test OpenTelemetry instrumentation with
      MockServer.
- [Setting up the Zipkin exporter](zipkin)
    - This module contains a fully functional example of configuring the
      OpenTelemetry SDK to use a Zipkin exporter and send spans to a
      Zipkin backend using the OpenTelemetry API.
    - Note: This example requires Docker to be installed.
