# HTTP Example

**Note:** This is an advanced scenario useful for people who want to *manually* instrument their own code.

This is a simple example that demonstrates how to use the OpenTelemetry SDK
to *manually* instrument a simple HTTP-based client/server application.
The example creates the **root span** on the client and sends the context
over the HTTP request. On the server side, the example shows how to extract the context
and create a **child span** with an attached **span event**.
